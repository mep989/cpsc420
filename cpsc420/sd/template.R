# Template for System Dynamics simulation
# CPSC 420 -- spring 2016


# Set up time. (delta.t and time vector).

# itot() and ttoi() functions (if desired).

# Simulation parameters (inputs).

# Stocks. (Create a vector and an initial condition for each.)

# Simulation loop. 
# For each slice of simulated time,

    # Compute the values of all the flows, based on previous stock values.

    # Compute the values of all the derivatives of the stocks ("primes").

    # Compute all the new stock values (including any derived stocks).


# Plot and analyze.
